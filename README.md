In this project a toy model is created for testing classification capabilities of β-VAEs.

Pokéminos (called lattice animals otherwise) are created from random seeds, randomly rotated and then fitted into 
3D volumes avoiding overlap between blocks. Many replicas of the same object in other same volume.

Output images are saved as mrcfiles.
