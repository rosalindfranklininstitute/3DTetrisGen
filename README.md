# 3DTetrisGen
In this project a set of 3D numpy arrays will be generated, each containing non-overlapping Tetris blocks of heterogeneous density surrounded by zero-density background. 

Steps:
- creating representations of ~5 types of 5x5x5 Tetris blocks
- random positioning of a Tetris block inside a larger 30x30x30 array (???)
- allowing for Tetris blocks to be randomly rotated (in steps of 90 degrees) / reflected
- allowing for more than one Tetris block to fit into the
