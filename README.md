In this project a toy model is created for testing classification capabilities of β-VAEs.

Pokéminos (called lattice animals otherwise) are created from random seeds, then randomly rotated and then fitted into 3D volumes in a way which avoids overlap between blocks. Many replicas of the same object in othe same volume.

Output images are saved as mrcfiles.
