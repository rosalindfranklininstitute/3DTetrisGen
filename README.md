# 3DTetrisGen
In this project a toy model is created for testing classification capabilities of Î²-VAEs.

Pokeminos (or otherwise lattice animals) are created from random seeds, randomly rotated and then fit in 3D volumes in a way which avoids overlap between blocks. Many replicas of the same object can be fit.

Output images are saved as mrcfiles.
