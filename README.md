In this project a toy model for testing classification capabilities of β-VAEs is created.

Pokéminos (otherwise called lattice animals) are created from Pokémon-derived string seeds, randomly rotated and then fitted into 
3D volumes with no overlap between creatures. Many replicas of the same Pokémino in one volume are supported.

Output images are saved as mrcfiles.
